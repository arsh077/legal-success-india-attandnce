# Logo Setup

## Quick Setup

1. **Save your logo here as `logo.png`**
   - File name must be exactly: `logo.png`
   - Location: `public/assets/logo.png`

2. **Logo Requirements**
   - Format: PNG (recommended for transparency)
   - Size: 200x200 pixels (or larger, will auto-scale)
   - Background: White or transparent
   - Shape: Circular crop preferred

## Using Your Provided Logo

You have two logo versions:
1. **Gold/Black background** - Original branding
2. **Black/White background** - Better for web (recommended)

### Recommended: Use the Black/White Version
- It's cleaner for web interfaces
- Works better with the app's color scheme
- More professional appearance

### How to Prepare:
1. Open the black/white logo image
2. Crop it to a circle (use any image editor)
3. Ensure white/transparent background
4. Save as `logo.png` in this folder

## Testing

After adding the logo:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Check the login page - logo should appear at the top
3. Check the sidebar - logo should appear in the header
4. If logo doesn't show, check browser console for errors

## Fallback

If the logo file is missing or fails to load, the app will automatically show "LS" initials as a fallback.
